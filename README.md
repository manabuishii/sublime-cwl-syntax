# sublime-cwl-syntax
Sublime Text syntax highlighting for CWL

# How to use this .

Currently I try to publish this under `PackageControl` .
Hopefully available soon.

Put `cwl.sublime-text` into `Packages/User` directory.

Mac:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User
```

Currently I check only Mac.
Maybe Linux and Windows is also same kind of directory structure.
